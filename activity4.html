           <p>we were to scan certain activities provided in the Ucertify website and some of the results are as follows:</p>
           <header>
               <h3 align="left">5.3.1 - Conducting vulnerability scanning using Nessus</h3>
               <h3 align="left">What it entails?</h3>
           </header>
           <p>- Identify the systems or networks you want to scan for vulnerabilities.<br>
              - Customize scan parameters such as port scanning, vulnerability checks.<br>
              - Launch the scan using Nessus, and it will systematically examine the selected targets for potential vulnerabilities.<br>
              - Review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities, their severity and potential impact.<br>
              - Provides a detailed report outlining the vulnerabilities found, their risk levels, and recommendations for mitigation.
        </p>

               <img src="images2/5.3.2-1.1.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/> <br><br>
               <p>At this stage, I entered the details provided for the task below as follows:</p>
               <img src="images2/5.3.2-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/> <br><br>
               <p>At this stage, I used the nmap command alongside the IP address provided below as follows:</p>
               <img src="images2/5.3.2-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/> <br><br>
               <p>At this stage, I encountered a problem because i couldn't see the 'ok' button to proceed with the task. i had to skip this step as a result of this. The result is as follows:</p>
               <img src="images2/5.3.2-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/> <br><br>
               <p>At this stage, I encountered the same problem as the previous step. The result is as follows:</p>

               <p>At this stage, I encountered the same problem from the previous steps. The result is as follows:</p>
               <img src="images2/5.3.2-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/><br><br>
               <p>As a result of this, I wasn't able to carry out this scanning activity successfully.</p>
