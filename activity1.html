                                            <p>A "fully digital enterprise" is described by Banerji in his blog as an integration of business units and stakeholders where management and smooth data sharing are made possible
                                                 by a shared digital infrastructure (2019). Numerous experts have developed frameworks to assess an organization's digital maturity. For instance, a digital enterprise is characterised by
                                                  completely data-driven operations, strategies, and processes (Kraft, 2022; Rumpenhorst, 2016).

                                                The process of digitization necessitates the transfer of an organization's resources, including data, processes, interfaces, and many other resources, to a network, 
                                                which inevitably raises the risk of unauthorised access (Rumpenhorst, 2016). This raises the need for appropriate network security controls and necessitates training all employees
                                                 on the security implications of a digital enterprise (Rumpenhorst, 2016; Spremić & Šimunic, 2018).

                                                Primarily, executives must recognise cyber security as a crucial component of their enterprise, akin to ensuring that their workplace is secured after hours (Almeida et al., 2020; Spremić & Šimunic, 2018).
                                                 Because they haven't previously been exposed to cyber security threats, industries that are new to digitalization face unknown challenges (Almeida et al., 2020). Hackers discovered new vulnerabilities in cars 
                                                 as they integrated more digital components, endangering the integrity of those systems (Spremić & Šimunic, 2018). A McKinsey and Company study estimates that the majority of contemporary cars contain 100 million lines of code;
                                                  in the next ten years, this number is predicted to triple (Deichmann et al., 2019).

                                                The procurement and distribution of energy could be enhanced by utilising data from the entire digital enterprise; 
                                                therefore, it is critical that international energy utilities keep up their network hardening and digitization efforts (Booth et al., 2019).
